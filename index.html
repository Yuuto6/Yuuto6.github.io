                    <p>Create a mobile app designed for college students to manage a free, flexible peer-tutoring network for younger community students, 
                        leveraging their academic expertise.  The app would function as a central hub, allowing college volunteers to securely log their availability, 
                        view pre-approved tutoring schedules, and receive instant notifications with the specific time, date, 
                        and verified on-campus or virtual location for each scheduled session.</p>

                This project aims to create a mobile application that matches college students with younger kids for flexible, 
                cost-free peer tutoring, complete with safe scheduling, alarms, and verified session management.  
                It places a high priority on usability, community involvement, and data security in addition to potential future features like gamified 
                progress tracking and AI-based tutor matching.
