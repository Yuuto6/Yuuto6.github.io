                <p>My main goal for the computer hardware path is to innovate hardware tools to further improve normal and gaming computers. 
                    It would also allow me to aid the people with malfunctioning computers. </p>

                    <p>Create a mobile app designed for college students to manage a free, flexible peer-tutoring network for younger community students, 
                        leveraging their academic expertise.  The app would function as a central hub, allowing college volunteers to securely log their availability, 
                        view pre-approved tutoring schedules, and receive instant notifications with the specific time, date, 
                        and verified on-campus or virtual location for each scheduled session.</p>
